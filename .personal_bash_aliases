# Personal bash aliases and utility functions

# These are for use on development machines,
# e.g. not production machines or machines with important credentials

# Anything that could be potentially dangerous (as many Linux commands are)
# has a comment stating: "Use at your own risk!"
# Usually these will require a sudo prompt, but not always.
# I do my best to explain what could go wrong, but it may not be comprehensive.

# I denote main sections with [Section Name]
# Current sections are:
# [String Manipulation]
# [General Utilities]
# [Navigation Utilities]
# [Disk Utilities]
# [Process Monitoring]
# [Networking]
# [Kubernetes]

# To utilize this, add the following lines to ~/.bashrc:
# if [ -f ~/.personal_bash_aliases ]; then
#     source ~/.personal_bash_aliases
# fi

# Dependencies (not needed unless you use the corresponding aliases)
# Not necessarily a comprehensive list - depends on your system
