# Personal Dotfiles

User-specific configuration files.

## General Layout

I exclude corporate logic as this is a personal repo.
Certain dotfiles get named accordingly (e.g. with prefix `.personal_`),
so they can be included/imported on non-personal machines, _if allowed_.

It might be useful to put some of these files in their own folder hierarchy.

## Conventions

Most of this content is personal workflow optimizations,
so it doesn't follow any strict conventions,
and certainly hasn't undergone any formal code review.

The next subsection lists tools that I generally use
when working on these files, but I don't have full coverage
for all configuration languages being used.

That being said, if you encounter anything you consider egregious,
feel free to send me an email at <alder314@gmail.com>,
or open an issue on this repository.
I'm always open to suggestions and willing to learn.
