# Personal Dotfiles
User-specific configuration files.

## General Layout
I exclude corporate logic as this is a personal repo.
Certain dotfiles get named accordingly (e.g. with prefix `.personal_`),
so they can be included/imported on non-personal machines, _if allowed_.

## Conventions
Most of this content is personal workflow optimizations, 
so it doesn't follow any strict conventions,
and certainly hasn't undergone any formal code review.

That being said, if you encounter anything you consider egregious,
feel free to send me an email at <alder314@gmail.com>,
or open an issue on this repository. 
I'm always open to suggestions and willing to learn.
